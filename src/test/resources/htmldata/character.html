The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel rapidly from place to place. His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the autonomic reflexes.
                        Note: his power enhancements through his transformation by the Queen and after battling Morlun - including his organic web glands and stingers -  have been undone after Spider-Man's deal with Mephisto.</div></div><div class="myLink" id="char-abilities">Abilities<div id="char-abilities-content" class="togCont" style="display:none;">Peter is an accomplished scientist, inventor and photographer.</div></div><div class="myLink" id="char-weapons">Weapons<div id="char-weapons-content" class="togCont" style="display:none;">None</div></div><div class="myLink" id="char-paraphernalia">Paraphernalia<div id="char-paraphernalia-content" class="togCont" style="display:none;">Spider-Man designed and constructed several devices that he traditionally carries as part of his full costume. This includes twin artificial <a href="/universe/Spider-Man%27s_Web-Shooters" title="Spider-Man&#39;s Web-Shooters">web-shooters</a> worn at the wrists, spare web cartridges attached to his belt, spider-tracer devices attuned to his spider-sense, the spider-signal light, and a compact camera. He has reconstructed his web shooters out of a high density plastic to avoid metal detectors, and has added modifications to detect low web-fluid levels, and propel spider-tracers.
                        For a time while allied with Iron Man, Spider-Man wore a costume that was equipped with filters in the mouth area to keep out toxins and allow him to breathe underwater, audio amplification, visual amplification (including vision in the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths), a short-range GPS microwave communication system (with a built-in fire, police, and emergency scanner), and retractable webbing under his arms that allow short bursts of gliding. The costume was made of a material that could serve as a bulletproof jacket against small caliber bullets. For the first upgrade to the costume, Stark added three mechanical waldo arms, which can grab and move objects as well housing cameras which transmit images back to the costume's eyepiece. The waldoes can also be used offensively in combat. The costume is now built out of a liquid metal nanofiber material allowing it to quickly change in appearance upon mental command into anything from Spider-Man's civilian clothes to his former costumes, as well as providing camouflage by blending with the surrounding colors.</div></div><div id="connections_lnk"><a href="http://marvel.com/universe3zx/utility/network.htm?character_id=2022" class="external text" title="http://marvel.com/universe3zx/utility/network.htm?character_id=2022" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Launch Connections</a></div></div></div>

Academically gifted, Peter displayed an uncanny affinity for science that was nothing short of genius.  Socially, however, he was painfully shy and the target of much cruelty by his peers at <a href="/universe/Midtown_High_School" title="Midtown High School">Midtown High School</a>. Attending a public science exhibit when Peter was 15-years old, he was bitten on the hand by a radioactive spider accidentally irradiated by a particle beam, empowering Peter with the arachnid&#39;s proportional strength and agility, and the ability to cling to almost any surface. <div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:187px;"><a href="/universe3zx/index.php?title=File:Spiderbite-LWeeks.jpg&amp;filetimestamp=20060212050552" class="image" title="Spiderbite-LWeeks.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/3/30/Spiderbite-LWeeks.jpg" width="185" height="136" border="0" class="thumbimage" /></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"></div></div></div>Most incredibly, he had gained a sixth sense that provided him with early warning of impending danger. Disguised, Peter tested his new-found abilities defeating professional wrestler <a href="/universe/Crusher_Hogan" title="Crusher Hogan" class="mw-redirect">Crusher Hogan</a> in the ring, and earning some cash.  Using his scientific prowess, he constructed a pair of artificial web-shooters that attached to his wrists. With an agent, a costume, and a new name, Spider-Man became an overnight sensation on television. Unconcerned with the rest of the world, he vowed to use his powers only to take care of himself and his aunt and uncle. After his first TV special ended, he allowed a burglar that he could have easily restrained to run past him and escape.  A few days later, Peter returned home to find his beloved Uncle Ben had been shot and killed. When Spider-Man confronted the killer hiding in the old Acme Warehouse at the waterfront, he discovered to his horror that his uncle&#39;s murderer was the burglar he apathetically allowed to pass. Consumed with guilt, he became aware at last that with great power comes great responsibility, just as his beloved uncle had once said.
                        <p>To help his Aunt May with finances, Peter took a freelance job at the Daily Bugle selling pictures of himself as Spider-Man to publisher <a href="/universe/Jameson,_J._Jonah" title="Jameson, J. Jonah">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. Despite Spider-Man rescuing his son, astronaut John Jameson, from a malfunctioning space capsule, Jonah used his newspaper to publicly condemn Spider-Man as a menace. Unlike heroes like the <a href="/universe/Fantastic_Four" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a> or the <a href="/universe/Avengers" title="Avengers">Avengers</a>, Spider-Man was mistrusted and feared by the public. At school, his popularity was no greater, as "Puny Parker" frequently clashed with bully <a href="/universe/Thompson,_Flash" title="Thompson, Flash">Flash Thompson</a> and his followers. Flash&#39;s girlfriend, <a href="/universe/Osborn,_Liz" title="Osborn, Liz">Liz Allan</a>, often complicated matters, harboring a crush on "Petey" and making Flash jealous.

                        <p>Spider-Man soon found himself facing a rogue&#39;s gallery of powerful thieves, gangsters, and megalomaniacs including the <a href="/universe/Chameleon" title="Chameleon">Chameleon</a>, the <a href="/universe/Tinkerer" title="Tinkerer">Tinkerer</a>, the <a href="/universe/Vulture_(Adrian_Toomes)" title="Vulture (Adrian Toomes)">Vulture (Adrian Toomes)</a>, <a href="/universe/Doctor_Octopus_(Otto_Octavius)" title="Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)">Doctor Octopus (Otto Octavius)</a>, the <a href="/universe/Sandman" title="Sandman" class="mw-redirect">Sandman</a>, <a href="/universe/Doctor_Doom_(Victor_von_Doom)" title="Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)">Doctor Doom</a>, and <a href="/universe/Electro" title="Electro" class="mw-redirect">Electro</a>. In Florida, he befriended Dr. Curtis Connors after administering an antidote to reverse his transformation into the terrible <a href="/universe/Lizard" title="Lizard" class="mw-redirect">Lizard</a>. Though he had many enemies, he also shared adventures with the <a href="/universe/Fantastic_Four" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a> (including rival the Human Torch), the <a href="/universe/Avengers" title="Avengers">Avengers</a>, the <a href="/universe/X-Men" title="X-Men">X-Men</a> and <a href="/universe/Daredevil" title="Daredevil" class="mw-redirect">Daredevil</a>. At the Daily Bugle, he discovered a friend and his first love, Jameson&#39;s secretary, <a href="/universe/Brant,_Betty" title="Brant, Betty">Betty Brant</a>. Even more villains clashed with Spider-Man including the <a href="/universe3zx/index.php?title=Iron_Patriot_(Norman_Osborn)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Iron Patriot (Norman Osborn) (page does not exist)">Green Goblin</a>, the Big Man and the Enforcers, <a href="/universe/Mysterio_(Quentin_Beck)" title="Mysterio (Quentin Beck)">Mysterio (Quentin Beck)</a>, and <a href="/universe/Kraven_(Sergei_Kravinoff)" title="Kraven (Sergei Kravinoff)">Kraven the Hunter</a>. Dating Betty became awkward after her brother, Bennett, was murdered in a clash between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man. Betty at first held Spider-Man responsible. Though she later recanted, the thought of Spider-Man reminded her of losing her brother. At home, Aunt May suffered a heart attack, causing Spider-Man to abandon a fight with the Green Goblin. For a while after, the public viewed Spider-Man as a coward, before he made a comeback. May's fragile health and poor finances, however, remain a lingering concern. Frustrated by their defeats at the hand of Spider-Man, six of his top villains gathered forces under Doctor Octopus to form the <a href="/universe/Sinister_Six" title="Sinister Six">Sinister Six</a>. Through wits and determination, Spider-Man defeated the group one at a time.
                        </p><p>Peter Parker’s confidence gradually increased. At the same time, his relationship with Betty crumbled as handsome reporter Ned Leeds stole her heart. Jameson took his campaign against Spider-Man to a new level, sponsoring the creation of the deranged <a href="/universe/Venom_(Mac_Gargan)" title="Venom (Mac Gargan)">Scorpion</a>, under Dr. Farley Stillwell. Though the Scorpion turned on Jameson, the publisher persisted with attacks against Spider-Man, and rented the first of a series of robotic Spider Slayers invented by Dr. Spencer Smythe. Spider-Man was able to use his technical know-how to defeat the Slayer. While Aunt May persisted with attempts to introduce Peter to <a href="/universe/Watson,_Mary_Jane" title="Watson, Mary Jane">Mary Jane Watson</a>, the niece of neighbor Anna Watson, Spider-Man tackled organized crime led by the Crime Master and the Green Goblin. Tired of the Bugle&#39;s harassment, Peter tried selling pictures for the Daily Globe but gave up when the Globe&#39;s editor proved too nosy.

College brought a fresh start with new peers including the wealthy <a href="/universe/Osborn,_Harry" title="Osborn, Harry">Harry Osborn</a>, son of industrialist Norman Osborn, and beauty queen of Standard High, Gwen Stacy; Flash Thompson followed Peter to ESU on an athletic scholarship. Consumed with worry about his aunt&#39;s hospitalization, Peter was misunderstood as an unfriendly snob by Harry and Gwen. Because a previous transfusion of his radioactive blood to Aunt May was slowly killing her, Spider-Man enlisted aid from <a href="/universe/Lizard_(Curtis_Connors)" title="Lizard (Curtis Connors)">Dr. Connors</a>. The antidote that had been called in to cure Aunt May was stolen, and Spider-Man fought like a madman to retain it. Before Spider-Man could deliver the antidote, ISO-36, he was trapped under rubble in a battle with the "Master Planner” (revealed to be Doctor Octopus). Spider-Man courageously forced his way out to administer the elixir to Aunt May.
                        <p>While Aunt May convalesced, Peter relaxed and befriended Harry and Gwen. Soon after, the Green Goblin negated Spider-Man&#39;s spider-sense, and kidnapped him. There, the Goblin revealed himself to be Harry&#39;s father, Norman. The two battled, but Spider-Man triumphed knocking the Goblin into live wires and chemicals. Norman was left with partial amnesia, blocking his memories of being Goblin and of Spider-Man's identity.
                        </p><p>The Avengers invited Spider-Man to join their ranks, but after facing the Hulk, he declined the offer, preferring the freedom of working alone. Meanwhile, Peter could no longer evade meeting Mary Jane. Assuming the worst, Peter was stunned to discover she was both gorgeous and vivacious.  Their first date involved riding into the city on Pete&#39;s new motorcycle take pictures of the Rhino. After another battle with the Lizard and new foe, the Shocker, Peter moved into Harry&#39;s apartment, rent free. Despite his new found independence, happiness eluded him. Worn out by Jameson&#39;s editorials, the public&#39;s fear of him, Aunt May&#39;s fragile health, slipping grades, and floundering love life, Peter decided to become Spider-Man no more. While Peter enjoyed time studying, and being with friends and family, crime escalated as the Kingpin&#39;s initiated his master plan to oversee the criminal underworld. After Peter rescued a watchman resembling Uncle Ben from two robbers, he renewed his vow to never let an innocent come to harm because he failed to act. Subsequently, Spider-Man battled the <a href="/universe/Kingpin" title="Kingpin">Kingpin</a>, Doctor Octopus (who became Aunt May&#39;s boarder), a new Vulture, a new Spider Slayer, and Mysterio.  He and the <a href="/universe/Human_Torch_(Johnny_Storm)" title="Human Torch (Johnny Storm)">Human Torch</a> went to Hollywood where they tackled Mysterio and the <a href="/universe/Wizard" title="Wizard">Wizard</a>.

                        <p>Though Peter dated MJ on occasion, he soon fell for the more serious-minded Gwen, causing tension between Harry and himself. Peter met Gwen&#39;s father, retired police Captain <a href="/universe/Stacy,_George" title="Stacy, George">George Stacy</a>, who studied Spider-Man, and questioned Peter about his first-hand experience. The Kingpin brainwashed Capt. Stacy (using Norman Osborn&#39;s equipment) into stealing police records. After Peter published pictures exposing Stacy, the Kingpin kidnapped George and Gwen. Spider-Man and Osborn rescued the two, but the Kingpin escaped. The Kingpin next focused on stealing a legendary stone tablet but Spider-Man retrieved it, and left it with Capt. Stacy. The Shocker stole it back, and Dr. Connors was forced by Man Mountain Marko to translate it for an aged gangster, <a href="/universe/Silvermane" title="Silvermane">Silvermane</a>. Connors revealed a formula for a youth potion. Silvermane drank the liquid, and became a young man again. Tragically, he could not stop the de-aging process, and shrank so small, he ultimately disappeared. Meanwhile, the stress on Dr. Connors triggered a transformation again. After a fierce melee across the city, with unwelcome help from the Human Torch, Spider-Man rescued Connors.

As the bond between Peter and Gwen grew ever stronger, it was approvingly observed by Gwen&#39;s father, Police Captain George Stacy, who also supported the efforts of Spider-Man. But tragedy struck when Captain Stacy was crushed by a falling chimney, saving an innocent child during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus. With his dying breath, Captain Stacy told Spider-Man, "take care of Gwen, Peter". Spider-Man had lost a great ally.
                        <p>Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her father&#39;s death.  Peter&#39;s conscience, already tormented by the ever present need to lie to Gwen, became even more troubled.  Yet their love prevailed through life&#39;s challenges - including Harry&#39;s drug addiction, and Spider-Man&#39;s aborted attempt to remove his own powers, that instead resulted in him being transformed into a six armed freak. In the end, it was death which separated the two lovers.  The Green Goblin kidnapped Gwen, and dropped her off the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man tried, but failed to save her.  In the vicious battle which followed, Norman was accidentally impaled by his own Goblin Glider. His apparent death was secretly observed by his son, Harry, who swore his own revenge on Spider-Man. Harry soon succumbed to the Osborn Legacy, kidnapping those whom Peter loved most, only barely being stopped from finishing the work that Norman Osborn had started.

Miles blamed Spider-Man for the death of Gwen, whom he had himself fallen in love with. The climax of the Jackal&#39;s plan was his creation of a <a href="/universe/Scarlet_Spider_(Ben_Reilly)" title="Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly)">Spider-Man clone</a>, but at the conclusion of the final battle, both the Jackal and the clone were killed. With their departure, Peter&#39;s life returned to normality, as much as it ever could for a college student who was secretly a costumed super-hero.
                        </p><p>In the meantime, Peter and Mary Jane realized that their relationship had become far more than just friendship. So much so that, shortly before his college graduation, Peter proposed to Mary Jane. But she had seen too much pain in her own family, and she turned him down. She left New York to pursue her modeling career in Florida, and Peter Parker moved on to post-graduate studies. It was a time for new challenges, and new friends.  But one thing would never change; the ever-present responsibility he faced as Spider-Man.

Also, departmental secretary Deborah Whitman was attracted to Peter, but failed to win his heart. Dawn Starr, undergraduate student, pretended to date Peter though actually wanting to sneak a look at an upcoming exam. Amy Powell tried to use Peter to make her fiancé Lance Bannon jealous.

She was also an unrepentant burglar who had a romantic fascination with her web-slinging hero. Spider-Man persuaded Felicia to turn away from crime, and the two of them became lovers - and crime-fighting partners. Felicia urged Peter to spend more and more time in costume. The glamorous Black Cat could never bear to see her super-hero living the squalid life of post-grad student. Becoming Spider-Man was made easier since Aunt May had recovered enough to return home and open the Parker residence as a boarding home for retired people, aided by Nathan. Aided by the Black Cat, Spider-Man faced Doc Ock and the <a href="/universe/Owl" title="Owl">Owl</a> - a battle which nearly cost Felicia her life.  Peter was brought crashing down to earth. He realized that without super-powers, Felicia was just like the others from his past, who had so often paid the price for Peter being Spider-Man.

She finally told Peter that she had known for some time about his secret identity. With Spider-Man&#39;s secret finally out in the open, Peter and Mary Jane&#39;s relationship found new depth.

Peter proposed for a second time, and was accepted. As newlyweds, Peter and Mary Jane shared happiness, but faced many perils also. Mary Jane was menaced by both Kraven the Hunter, and by Venom, both of whom knew Peter&#39;s identity. Mary Jane loved Peter, and had deep respect for his sense of responsibility. But she was unprepared for the loneliness, the fear for his life, and the nagging doubt that perhaps Peter needed Spider-Man far more than he needed her. During this time, Spider-Man gained the cosmic powers of <a href="/universe/Captain_Universe" title="Captain Universe">Captain Universe</a> making him virtually indestructible, able to fly, shoot cosmic energy blasts, and possess unimaginable strength.

The pair were eventually revealed as robot agents of the Chameleon, part of a plan prompted by Harry Osborn, recently returned as the Green Goblin.

May hospitalized, and not expected to recover. Peter&#39;s frustration at life&#39;s injustices boiled over into violence. Encountering the recently reformed and powerless Scorpion, Spider-Man cruelly beat his former foe close to death - ignoring his victim&#39;s pleas for mercy. Calling himself "the Spider", it seemed that Peter was even beyond Mary Jane&#39;s powers to heal him.

Peter&#39;s recovery from his dark madness coincided with the return of a figure from Peter&#39;s distant past - his clone, created by the Jackal. The clone had survived, and had wandered the U.S. using the adopted name "Ben Reilly". Learning that Aunt May was very ill, the clone returned to New York, just in time to see her pass away. He adopted a costumed identity as the "Scarlet Spider", and portrayed himself as Peter&#39;s long-lost cousin. Peter and Ben became friends, even almost brothers. The Jackal himself had also survived. Deceived at the hands of Norman Osborn, the Jackal declared that in fact Ben was the original, and Peter the clone. Though Peter took the revelation badly, Ben subsequently took over the role of Spider-Man, leaving Peter and pregnant Mary Jane free to enjoy a "normal" life. Peter returned to his scientific career, though hampered by having never completed his doctorate. He and MJ also tried moving to Portland, until they realized that New York was where they truly belonged. But all too soon, their new world was shattered when Norman Osborn burst back into their lives. He also had survived his apparent death, and was the mastermind behind all of the Jackal&#39;s schemes. Norman killed Ben, revealing him to be the clone after all. But Norman&#39;s schemes went even deeper and deadlier than ever - he apparently caused Mary Jane to miscarry the baby and held Peter&#39;s Aunt May hostage. The woman believed to have been Aunt May that had died was a genetically modified actress, part of a subtle plot which was never carried to fruition.

                        <p>Morlun returned again, viciously beating Spider-Man, removing an eye, and hospitalizing him. Mary Jane tried to stop Morlun from finishing off her husband. But when Morlun threatened to kill her, Spider-Man gave the last of his energy to protect her. With stingers that burst from his wrists, Spider-Man slayed Morlun. Spider-Man then apparently died; however, a new Peter Parker emerged from the old corpse, now more fully embracing his "other" self - his spider personae. Retaining his stingers, he discovered other new abilities including night vision, greater control of his skin adhesive properties, and enhanced sensory perceptions, such as being able to sense the vibrations traveling through his webline. <a href="/universe/Iron_Man_(Anthony_Stark)" title="Iron Man (Anthony Stark)">Tony Stark</a> looking at Peter as his protégé, gave Spider-Man a new technologically advanced costume with a red and gold color scheme as a gift.

                        <p>In the aftermath of a tragedy in Stamford, Connecticut, in which a band of televised heroes were unable to prevent the villain <a href="/universe/Nitro" title="Nitro" class="mw-redirect">Nitro</a> from killing an entire elementary school full of children and parts of the surrounding community, the U.S. government propelled forward the Superhuman Registration Act requiring the superhero community to register themselves as living weapons of mass destruction, and reveal their identities to the government. The act was supported by Tony Stark, who became the leader of the Pro-Registration side. The superheroic community was split between registering or refusing and becoming an outlaw. Leading the opposition to the act was <a href="/universe/Captain_America_(Steve_Rogers)" title="Captain America (Steve Rogers)">Captain America</a>, in defense of heroes' right to privacy. To support Iron Man, and perhaps obtain the ever-elusive respect from the public by compliance with the Act, Spider-Man made the difficult decision (with support from May and Mary Jane) to reveal his identity to the world during a press conference. As Spider-Man now faces the danger of public exposure to his family and loved ones, and the prospect of having to capture his renegade friends in what has become an all-out <a href="/universe/Civil_War" title="Civil War">Civil War</a> in the superpowered community, Peter regretted his decision. After witnessing a prison in the Negative Zone for super humans who refused to register, Parker fled Avengers Tower with his family, clashing with Iron Man during his exit. He aided Captain America and the forces opposing registration, culminating in a major battle during the jailbreak of the heroes imprisoned in the Negative Zone, Captain America's surrender, and the end of the Civil War. Spider-Man has remained a member of the unsanctioned Avengers team in the aftermath. Since Spider-Man's identity is now public knowledge, the Kingpin arranged a sniper to slay the Parker family. Though Mary Jane was spared, Parker was unable to prevent his aunt from getting shot. May was left in a coma on the verge of death. The anguish of yet another loved one injured because of his life as Spider-Man embittered the hero. He resumed wearing his black cloth costume, reflective of the dark times while his Aunt May was precariously close to death. Spider-Man confronted the Kingpin in Ryker's Island prison, and, while unmasked, beat him within an inch of his life, vowing to come back and kill him if Aunt May died.

                        <a name="A_Brand_New_Day_and_Hitting_the_Big_Time" id="A_Brand_New_Day_and_Hitting_the_Big_Time"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> A Brand New Day and Hitting the Big Time </span></h3>
                        <p>With time running out, Peter tried several avenues, from the technological to the mystical, to save May's life. At a dead-end, <a href="/universe/Mephisto" title="Mephisto">Mephisto</a> appeared to Peter and Mary Jane offering to prevent May’s death, but at the cost of their holy bond of matrimony. After spending one more day together, Mary Jane selflessly took the initiative and agreed to the bargain, knowing Peter would never forgive himself if he rejected a chance to save May. She had faith that their love would be strong enough to reunite them. As a result, one event was removed from the lives of Peter and Mary Jane - they were never married, and Aunt May survived the shooting. Realizing how dangerous it was to reveal his secret identity, Peter, through the combined efforts of Tony Stark, Stephen Strange, and Reed Richards, had the world not only forget he was Spider-Man, but be mystically confused if ever considering they were the same person. Mary Jane was exempted from forgetting, but later broke up with him, unable to cope with the strain of being Spider-Man's girlfriend.
                        </p><p>Single and jobless, Peter was reunited with his old friend Harry Osborn - whose death had been part of an elaborate hoax by his father. Spider-Man also returned to using web-shooters, rather than his own self-generated organic webbing, for reasons that have not yet been revealed. Over time, Peter unmasked again to a select group of heroes including the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. Through connections with Marla Jameson, Peter acquired a dreat job at Horizon Labs, where his skills as a brilliant scientist and inventor have earned him a steady paycheck. Marla's death, killed by Spider-Slayer Alistaire Smythe, inspired Spider-Man to promise that nobody else dies on his watch. The Jackal (or possibly a clone), partnered with the Queen and turned New York City into "Spider-Island" wherein bedbugs gave many the powers of Spider-Man. Peter and his colleagues at Horizon helped stop the plague. Peter's girlfriend at the time, forensic detective Carlie Cooper, temporarily gained powers in the event. Afterwards, she discovered Peter's secret identity and broke up with him. Despite their differences, she remains an ally.
                        </p><p>One of Parker's experiments at Horizon accidentally bestowed super powers into an irresponsible teen (Andrew Maguire). As Alpha, Maguire became Spider-Man's arrogant sidekick, with little regard for Spider-Man's concern for his well being.
